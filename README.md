# EventMedalHB_25
Medal Development Process:

## Challenge:

Due to the higher requirements I want to achieve every year, I challenged myself by creating a simplistic RGB badge for the event, which should feature:

- a simplistic RGB-lit badge

- multiple materials and machines I learned to work with in the last year (laser cutter, 3D-Printing)

- Multiple layers minimalistic design

### Requirements for the badge of 2025:

- Battery powered

- 1-3 two LEDs

- Materials: Acryl (PMMA), wood, and PLA

### Materials:

- birch wood

- Acry(PMMA)

- Anycubic PLA purple matte

### Software and Tools Used:

- Inkscape

- Laser cutter (Lightburn)

- 3D-Printer ( Prusa-, CuraSlicer)

## Design Process:

- The medal design is inspired by the normal participant badge design. 

The participant badge design orients itself on the shapes and basic design elements. 

which are present in the 2025 logo. For example, picking up the hexagon shape for the outline 

of the participant badge.

- For a better differentiation and a better feeling when the badge is worn or held in hand, the winner medal became a different shape than the participant badge and was made out of a round shape rather than using another hexagon cutout.

### 1. Inkscape:

- Designing the concept of the Badge, making design decisions before a first prototype is made

- Structuring the layers of the design

- Setting the size of the badge exporting as a plain.svg

### 2. Laser cutting

- Chosen material, in this case birch wood (3 mm), is used for all badges, including the participant badges.

- For the acrylic, PMMA is used. It's the first time working with it, and it worked like a charm.

3. 3D-Printing

- The 3D-printed parts needed the most prototyping due to the fact that the mechanism of the badge should be a click mechanism.

	- All in all, seven iterations of the mechanism were created until a good result for the mechanism could be achieved.

	- The printers that were used are the Prusa MK4 and Ender3-V2

  - Credits [@smdollins](https://www.printables.com/@smdollins) for the snug and good battery holder that was used to power the LEDs in the Medal[2025 Coin Cell Battery LED Light](https://www.printables.com/model/289171-2025-coin-cell-battery-led-light)

	- Lessons learned:

		- When developing a click mechanism like the one made in this project with an FDM 3D-printer, keep in mind in which direction the layers of the PLA are printed on to each other. The direction influences the stability and strength of the printed part.
