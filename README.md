# EventMedalHB_25

Medal Developement Process:

## Challenge:
Due to the higher requirements i want to achive every year, I challenged myself by creating a simplistic RGB badge for the event which should feature:
- a simplistic RGB lit Badge
- multiple materials and machines that i learned to work with in the last year(lasercutter, 3D-Printing)
- Multiple Layers minimalistic design

### Requirements for the badge of 2025:
- Battery powered
- 1-3 two leds
- Materials: Acryl(PMMA), Wood and PLA

### Materials:
- birch wood
- Acry(PMMA)
- Anycubic PLA purple matt

### Software and Tools used:
- Inkscape
- Lasercutter (Lightburn)
- 3D-Printer (Prusa-, Curaslicer)

## Design Process:
- The medal design is inspired by the normal participant badge design. 
The participant badge design orients itself on the shapes and basic design elements, 
which are present in the 2025 Logo. For example picking up the hexagon shape for the outline 
of the participant badge.

- For a better differentation, and a better feeling when the badge is worn or held in hand the winner medal became a different shape than the participant Badge, was made out of a round shape rather than using another hexagon cut out.

### 1. Inkscape:
- Designing the concept of the Badge, making design decisions before a first prototype is made
- Structuring the layers of the design
- Setting the size of the Badge exporting as a plain.svg

### 2. Lasercutting
- Choosen Material, in this case birch wood (3mm) is used for all badges including the participant badges
- For the acryl PMMA is used, its the first time working with it and it worked like a charm

3. 3D-Printing
- The 3D-Printed parts needed the most prototyping due to the fact that the mechanism of the badge should be a click mechanism.
	- All in all 7 iterations of the Mechanism were created until and good result for the mechanism could be achived
	- The printers which were used are: Prusa MK4 and Ender3-V2
  - Credits smdollins for the snug and good battery holder, that were used to power the leds in the Medal[2025 Coin Cell Battery LED Light](https://www.printables.com/model/289171-2025-coin-cell-battery-led-light)
	- Lessons learned: 
		- when developing a click mechanism like the one made in this project with a FDM 3D-printer, keep in mind in which direction the layers of the PLA are printed. The direction influences the stability and strength of the printed part.
